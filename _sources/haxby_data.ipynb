    "\n",
    "This part of the `tutorial` aims to make `participants` familiar with the `dataset` we are going to use during this session and also address/introduce/recap some important aspects concerning `datasets` within `machine learning`/`decoding`. The objectives 📍 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (re-)familiarize everyone with important `datasets` aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "- exploring and understand the `tutorial dataset`\n",

    "## A short primer on datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to avoid \"just talking\" about `brain decoding` in theory and also showcase how the respective `models` and workflows can be implemented, as well as run to give you some first hands-on experience. Even though we would have loved to get everyone to bring their data and directly apply the things we talk about, it's unfortunately a bit too time-consuming for this setting. Thus, we decided to utilize an `example dataset` that is ready to go and \"small enough\" to run `decoding models` locally, ie on laptops. You might think \"One of those tutorials again...it works with the example dataset but I have little or no chance on running it on/adapting it to my data.\" and we would agree based on workshops we did ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we tried our best to address this here by utilizing `software` whose `workflows` and `processing steps` are rather agnostic and implemented via `high-level API` that _should_ allow a comparably straightforward application to different kinds of `data`. This specifically refers to a set of core aspects concerning the dataset's structure and information entailed therein. How about a brief recap?\n",

    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to focus on the `input` (`data`). As you heard before, it is usually expected to be structured as `samples` X `features`. \n",

    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "A `sample` could be considered an `observation`/`data point`/one distinct entity in the `dataset`/one distinct part of the `dataset`. For example, if you want to `predict` what a participant perceived based on their `brain activation`/`response`, the `samples` could entail the `fMRI` `scans` or estimated `contrast images` of that `participant`. If you want to `predict` whether a `participant` exhibited a certain `behavior`, e.g. a captured by a `clinical measure`, etc., then the `samples` could comprise different `participants`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A `feature` on the other hand would entail/describe certain aspects of a given `sample`. For example, if you want to `predict` what a participant perceived based on their `brain activation`/`response`, the `features` could entail the `voxel pattern` at a certain `ROI` at the given `sample`. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to make a given `dataset` \"ready\" for `machine learning`/`decoding`, we need to get it into the respective structure. Lucky for us, the tools we are going to explore, specifically `nilearn`, incorporate this aspect and are make the corresponding process rather easy. What you need to run `machine learning`/`decoding` on your `dataset` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- know what your `samples` are (e.g. `time series`, `statistical maps`, etc.)\n",
    "- know what your `features` are (e.g. `voxel pattern` of an `ROI`, `annotations`, etc.)\n",
    "- get the `dataset` in the form `samples` X `features`, ie `samples` are `rows` and `features` are `columns`\n",

    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Classical\" `machine learning`/`decoding` models and the underlying algorithms operate on the assumption that are more `predictors` or `features` than there are `sample`. In fact many more. Why is that?\n",
    "Consider a high-dimensional `space` whose `dimensions` are defined by the number of `features` (e.g. `10 features` would result in a space with `10 dimensions`. The resulting `volume` of this `space` is the amount of `samples` that could be drawn from the `domain` and the number of `samples` entail the `samples` you need to address your `learning problem`, ie `decoding` outcome. That is why folks say: \"get more data\", `machine learning` is `data`-hungry: our `sample` needs to be as representative of the high-dimensional domain as possible. Thus, as the number of `features` increases, so should the number of `samples` so to capture enough of the `space` for the `decoding model` at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This referred to as the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) and poses as a major problem in many fields that aim to utilize `machine learning`/`decoding` on unsuitable data. Why is that?\n",
    "Just imagine we have way more `features` than `samples`, ie `50 features` and `10` `samples`. Instead of having a large amount of `samples` within the `space`, allowing to achieve a sufficient coverage of the latter, we now have a very high-dimensional `space` (`50 dimensions`) and only very few `samples` therein, basically not allowing us to capture nearly enough of the `space` as we would need to. This can result in expected outcomes, misleading results or even lead to complete `model` failure. Furthermore, respective `datasets` often lead to `models` that are `overfitted` and don't `generalize` well. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things that can be done to address this, including `feature selection`, `projection` into `lower-dimensional` `spaces` or `representations` or `regularization`. \n",

However, this is unfortunately outside the scope of this session. Thus, we are just going to plot a few of them so you get an impression.\n",
